abstract = {A review.  Mol. dynamics (MD) allows the study of biol. and chem. systems at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds.  It complements expt. while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with exptl. techniques.  Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber.  Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in Apr. 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package.  The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979.  The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in Apr. 2012, includes a substantial no. of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas.  We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years.  Figure 1 shows the performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680. [on SciFinder(R)]},
